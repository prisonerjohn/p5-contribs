"""
Reads a configuration file listing direct links to contributions grouped by
category. The config file is formatted using the following style:

    # A comment. Everything after the hash is ignored
    [Library : Sound] # Type of software : category name.
    # Contribution ID \ A url of a library in the sound category
    043 \ http://example.com/libs/soundlib1.txt
    # Contribution ID \ Another url of a library in the sound category
    074 \ http://example.org/libs/soundlib2.txt

    [Library : Vision] # Another category
    012 \ http://example.net/libs/visionlib.txt

After parsing the config file, information on each contribution is retrieved 
from the text files, and the contribution is assumed to be hosted at the same
address as the txt, but with .zip.  For example, visionlib in the example above
would be found at http://example.com/libs/visionlib.zip

This script takes two arguments
  Arg 1: The name of a config file to read from
  Arg 2: The name of a file to write to. This file will be overwritten if it
         already exists
         
If no arguments are passed, it uses the following defaults
  Arg 1: sources.conf
  Arg 2: ../pde/contribs.txt
