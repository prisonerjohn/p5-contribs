  "paragraph": "A Skweezee is an interactive system based on the physical deformation of soft, conductive materials. Skweezees implement squeeze interactions, including both input (squeezes) and output (actuation). This library is a connecting link between an Arduino that continuously measures electrical resistances within conductive  material (input sensing) and a Processing sketch generating output (actuation). The library offers vector and time series analysis to extract features from the sensed signals in order to generate rich actuation that preserves dynamics of the squeezes.
