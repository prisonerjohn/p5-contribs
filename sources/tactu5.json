  "sentence": "Tactu5 aids in the creation of algorithmic music in real time. It consists of a set of classes focused on defining musical elements, utility classes and an aggregator.",
  "paragraph": "Tactu5 does not include a built-in synthesis system and is not focused on a specific communication protocol. Tactu5 has been designed to be quite easily integrated with existing software synthesis systems (Csound, PureData, SuperCollider etc.) through network communication (for instance, [oscP5](http://www.sojamo.de/libraries/oscP5/)) or by directly using some Java binding.",
