  "paragraph": "There are four main classes with which you should be familiar: 1) BoundingBox defines the sketch's geographic 'envelope' by mapping a shapefile's geographic coordinates on to the viewable space of the sketch; 2) Lines is used to read and display single-part and multi-part line data; 3) Points is used to read and display point data; and 4) Polygons is used to read and display single and multi-part polygon data (this only works with shapefiles for now). GPX display needs work.",
