The idea is to present solutions to the same task in as many different languages as possible, to demonstrate how languages are similar and different, and to aid a person with a grounding in one approach to a problem in learning another. This example set compiles the available RosettaCode.org tasks for Processing (Java, Python, and R modes).",
